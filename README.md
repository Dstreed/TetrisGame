# Basic Tetris

## Introduction

Tetris is a game based on puzzle shapes and tiles.Try to get your personal high score by moving each of the 5 randomly selected Tetromino shapes sideways and/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that they form a solid horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. For each line you will receive 10 points.

this is my first game based on html, css and javascript languages.

## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Github
- Google Fonts

## Functionnality

The goal is to complete the maximum number of lines without reaching the top of the screen.

It is therefore necessary to place the pieces wisely so as not to make holes.We know in advance the next incoming piece, that is to say the one that will be released once the piece is placed in the fall
